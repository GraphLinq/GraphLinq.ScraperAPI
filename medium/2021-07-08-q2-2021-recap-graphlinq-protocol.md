# Q2, 2021 Recap — Graphlinq Protocol

![GraphLinq Protocol Q2 2021 Progress Update][image_ref_MCpZTmNJUUtKSGJ2V2hFUE5y]

The 2nd quarter of this year just ended and here are highlights of everything that GraphLinq achieved in Q2 of 2021. Our motive has been to provide a seamless experience to all users of the platform, and hereby we are proud to share with you our progress update.

**Major GraphLinq IDE Updates in Q2, 2021**

**IDE Update v1.0.6**

In this update, we integrated new blocks to fetch data prices from Liquidity Provider tokens, and we will soon integrate more for lending / APY information over the different available protocols (such as [Compound](https://compound.finance/), [Aave](https://aave.com/), etc.)

Also, we’ve added connectors and blocks to check pairs and live events from certain exchanges which enables you to create graphs for fetching, monitoring, analyzing & storing data from these exchanges available on Graphlinq IDE.

Our goal is to have the entire Crypto/DeFi ecosystem directly available on GraphLinq Protocol, so you can create your graph and customize it.

In the GLQ IDE UPDATE v.1.0.6, there were plenty of integrations for several Centralized Exchanges.

CEX added in this release:

* [Bittrex](https://global.bittrex.com/)

* [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/)

# **Partnerships (Q2, 2021)**

1. **Partnership with Unicrypt**

We Announced our partnership with Unicrypt. Unicrypt Network is a decentralized service provider with available cross-chains (on top of 4 blockchains as of now). They have 3 Dapps up and running ready to be empowered with this collaboration. As GraphLinq is made to automate and simplify blockchain-oriented tasks we decided to take it one step further by creating a whole API exposing their data needs from the live blockchain feed.

**2. Partnership with Polygon**

As part of our development progress, we decided to take the road of a layer 2 solution to avoid our gas fees issues. We are excited to announce our partnership with Polygon Chain (Previously known as Matic).

GraphLinq Protocol will host its layer two solutions over the Polygon chain to optimize the efficiency of execution costs & the average time of transactions per second: Polygon block time is 2 seconds and the average transaction fee is $0.00004 which is exactly what we need to run our service efficiently.

We will also integrate the Polygon chain into our Engine and our IDE to create connectors, events, and live information from the chain activity to expand our audience and possibilities!

**3. Partnership with smartdex**

A new and incredible project for decentralized trading just came out on the Polygon chain known as smartdex, powered by Autonio. They are rethinking the way of making DEX trades and farming/staking pools on AMM protocols.

We now have our own GLQ token over the Matic chain, so we want to give the possibility to our community to profit from their activities and be able to trade on smartdex.

As part of our partnership, GraphLinq hosted a farming pool with rewards on swap.smartdex.app/#/farm

**4. Partnership with Elrond**

We are honored to announce that GraphLinq partnered up with Elrond for integration on the Engine, IDE, App & Analytics.

As of right now, you can go to the GraphLinq IDE to experiment with the Elrond components and create your first smart workflow. For example, you could set up a flow that sends a telegram notification every time you receive a transaction in Maiar. GraphLinq will launch more blocks, and pre-made templates for Elrond next week.

**Live Integrations For Elrond On GraphLinq**:

-> Connector for Elrond Chain

-> Block for watching current balance on any Elrond wallet address

-> Get HyperBlock, Get Tx & Get Tx Status

Get started: [https://ide.graphlinq.io](https://ide.graphlinq.io)

As the ecosystem of Elrond grows, GraphLinq will continue to add more integrations onto their nocode ecosystem.

Check out the upcoming integrations on GraphLinq for Elrond’s components and other information: [https://elrond.com/blog/nocode-elrond-workflow-automation-graphlinq/](https://elrond.com/blog/nocode-elrond-workflow-automation-graphlinq/)

# **Other Major Updates (Q2, 2021)**

* **Auto-Swap Announcement**

The Uniswap protocol empowers developers, liquidity providers, and traders to participate in a decentralized financial marketplace that is open and accessible to all. After this powerful integration, users on GraphLinq will be able to automate swaps/trades on Uniswap based on events triggered off-chain or on-chain.

Example 1: Link Uniswap’s Auto-Swap connector with an off-chain block (like Coingecko or LiveCoinWatch) to make a trade on Uniswap when a certain price of your preferrable asset is met. The only thing you need to make sure of is that you have enough ETH on Uniswap for paying gas fees.

Example 2: Link Uniswap’s Auto-Swap connector with on-chain blocks (like Ethereum & BSC). You can set an auto-swap for functions like, if ETH fees drop by x% in ’n’ time, place a buy order on ETH/or any other ERC20 token on Uniswap. We believe this example has a huge potential in opening up the endless possibilities with no-code automation on Ethereum’s Blockchain.

The initial Uniswap integration is the first stepping stone for GraphLinq on the path of providing a seamless DeFi provisioning scheme for enterprise developers, traders, defi enthusiasts, system integrators, and much more.

* **GraphLinq Analytics Platform Launch**

New Analytics beta platform launch, made using our nocode IDE. This shows a powerful real-life use case of GraphLinq Protocol. Now track #GLQ Price, ATH, Holders, Volume, Market Cap, Supply, Latest Trades & many more data visually!

Support was added for Unicrypt already, and will now be added for Polygon & Elrond very soon!

* **GLQ Vesting and Unlock Schedule**

During our ILO and private sale, which was historic for Graphlinq, we sold 50% of GLQ’s total supply. Which equates to 250 million GLQ. 73 million of the remaining 250 million GLQ supply was used via Unicrypt Protocol to initialize the GLQ-WETH pool on UniSwap. The remaining GLQ tokens were locked and vested according to the announced schedule: [https://graphlinq.medium.com/announcing-glq-vesting-unlock-schedule-over-unicrypt-52f292133612](https://graphlinq.medium.com/announcing-glq-vesting-unlock-schedule-over-unicrypt-52f292133612)

* **Buy GLQ with Fiat on app.graphlinq.io via Transak**

GLQ can now be bought with 40+ currencies and 70+ countries.

* **Automation of trades on Binance and MEXC via GraphLinq**

GraphLinq has enabled trading access over the leading centralized exchanges for cryptocurrencies: This enables connecting logical blocks with your [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en), and [MEXC](https://www.mxc.com/) account for making limit SPOT Buy & Sell trade orders from any listed market pair.

You can now also create a trading bot on one of the supported CEX (we will integrate more CEXs with time) over your running graphs based on an on-chain activity: you just need to connect whatever you need based on your preferable triggers, conditions, and use the trade blocks to trigger your order.

Here is a list of a bunch of basics templates we’ve added for you to play with trades from centralized exchanges (Binance & MXC):

* [Create a Sell Limit Order on Binance](https://ide.graphlinq.io/?loadGraph=11)

* [Create a Buy Limit Order on Binance](https://ide.graphlinq.io/?loadGraph=12)

* [Create a Buy Market Order On Binance](https://ide.graphlinq.io/?loadGraph=16)

* [Fetch your Ethereum Wallet Balance on MXC](https://ide.graphlinq.io/?loadGraph=13)

* [Create a Sell Market Order on MXC](https://ide.graphlinq.io/?loadGraph=14)

* [Create a Buy Market Order on MXC](https://ide.graphlinq.io/?loadGraph=15)
