# **GraphLinq & QuickSwap Announces Partnership For Integration on our Nocode Ecosystem**

![][image_ref_MSo2R0hxS2lLVWRQajc0cFpsU25JZjVnLmpwZWc=]

Following up on our partnership with Polygon and Elrond. We are growing our ecosystem and are proud to add integration for our newest partner, QuickSwap. — [**QuickSwap](https://info.quickswap.exchange/home)** is the leading DEX on Polygon with nearly $1 billion in liquidity, almost $100 million in daily trading volume, and approximately 20 thousand daily active users. QuickSwap allows its users to trade ERC-20 assets with very low gas fees.

You can go to the [GraphLinq IDE](https://app.graphlinq.io/) to experiment with the QuickSwap components as we have added some logical blocks ready on our IDE for QuickSwap components and create your first smart workflow.

**About QuickSwap**

QUICK is the native governance and utility token that powers QuickSwap — a decentralized exchange that runs on the Polygon Network in order to provide faster and cheaper transactions on Ethereum. QUICK can be used to vote on governance proposals concerning QuickSwap and can be staked to earn a portion of trading fees. Every day, tens of thousands of users rely on QuickSwap for their trades.
