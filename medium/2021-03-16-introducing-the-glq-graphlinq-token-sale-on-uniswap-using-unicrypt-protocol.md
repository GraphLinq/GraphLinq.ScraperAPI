**Introduction**

Graphlinq, launched in early 2021, has already come a long way. Before announcing the token sale of its native cryptocurrency, GLQ, the [graphlinq team](https://docs.graphlinq.io/introduction#ourfounders,behindgraphlinq) made their platform available to the public. Developers, organizations, blockchain enthusiasts, and even crypto newcomers can [create and deploy Graphs](https://ide.graphlinq.io/) on Graphlinq without having to write a single line of code using premade templates. In [Graphlinq’s first AMA](https://youtu.be/vnm9b43tb-c), the founders can be found introducing Graphlinq in a lot more detail for anyone who’s keen.

**What Exactly Is Graphlinq?**

GraphLinq is a set of tools including an IDE & an engine that run simultaneously with multiple blockchains and centralized data stream to offer a service of automatization of a process without coding skill required.

Graphlinq even lets you connect to Ethereum/BSC data-feed almost for free and in real-time using GraphLinq to help you suit your Trading, DeFi & similar needs. The platform has live drag-and-drop plugins & a set of templates to choose from. Whether users want to fetch data from a decentralized or centralized stream and send it to telegram, webhook, discord, etc. or if they want to set up a trading bot based on some indicators, anything and everything blockchain oriented can be automated with the help of Graphlinq Protocol.

**What is GLQ?**

GLQ is the native token for the Graphlinq ecosystem built on top of Ethereum (ERC20). GLQ will be used to run a graph on the platform’s test net or main net to execute different processes over the blockchain to automate tasks, triggering events, and much more. GLQ will have more use cases as the ecosystem grows, as mentioned in [Graphlinq’s Documentation](https://docs.graphlinq.io/).

All of the smart contracts of Graphlinq Protocol (including tokensale and token smart contracts) have been audited by [CTDSEC](https://graphlinq.io/Cybersecurity_Audit_CTDSEC_GraphLinq_Presale.pdf) & [Rugs Detective](https://graphlinq.io/Rug_Detectives_Audit_Report.pdf).
