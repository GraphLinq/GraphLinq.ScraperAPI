# Track real-time status of GraphLinq Chain, App & Other Systems on GraphLinq Status

![][image_ref_MSpSYThyRDhVY19LRnVpMnpfUHJtM3JBLmpwZWc=]

We are excited to announce the launch of the new [GraphLinq Status](http://status.graphlinq.io) page that shows the status of the [App](http://app.graphlinq.io), [Marketplace](http://marketplace.graphlinq.io), [IDE](http://ide.graphlinq.io), [Nodes running on GLQChain](http://network.graphlinq.io), [Explorer](http://explorer.graphlinq.io), [AI Assistant](http://ai.graphlinq.io), etc.

The previous GraphLinq Status page that only showed the status of nodes running on GLQChain is now moved to [network.graphlinq.io](http://network.graphlinq.io). Additionally, the status website (status.graphlinq.io) now shows the status of the chain, explorer, GraphLinq App, IDE, staking, nodes, and more in real time.

We are excited about this update and are committed to ensuring the GraphLinq Network is robust, secure, and decentralized. Thank you for being a part of the GraphLinq community, and we look forward to your continued support.

**What is GraphLinq?**

The GraphLinq ecosystem comprises two main components: the GraphLinq Chain and the GraphLinq Protocol. The GraphLinq Protocol is an automated process management solution that is designed to make it easy for users to deploy and manage various types of automation without the need for coding skills. This protocol is made up of four key components: the IDE, the App, the Engine, and the Marketplace.

The **GraphLinq Chain** is a blockchain that is specifically designed to support the GraphLinq Protocol. The chain is a Proof-of-Authority (POA) blockchain that provides a secure and scalable platform for running automation. The GraphLinq Protocol utilizes the GraphLinq Chain to ensure that automation is executed securely and accurately.
