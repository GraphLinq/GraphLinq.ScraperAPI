# **Q1, 2023 Recap — Graphlinq**

![][image_ref_MSp5bFgyN3VZMGFIUVhVWWVLMlFQeE5nLnBuZw==]

Here are highlights of everything that GraphLinq achieved in Q1 of 2023. Our motive has been to provide a seamless experience to all users of the platform, and hereby we are proud to share with you our progress update.

### **GraphLinq Chain Mainnet Launch**

One of the most significant milestones achieved by Graphlinq in Q1 was the launch of the GraphLinq Chain mainnet, an EVM-compatible PoA blockchain. The launch of the mainnet brings the platform closer to realizing its vision of a more decentralized and automated future.

**Network Specifications**

By providing optimized access for users in different regions, the GraphLinq Chain is working to ensure a fast and reliable experience for its community.

### GraphLinq Bridge Goes Live:

Move Your GLQ from Ethereum Network to GraphLinq Chain. The GraphLinq Bridge is finally live and ready to use! Now, you can move your GLQ from the Ethereum network to the GraphLinq Chain and vice versa, quickly & easily.

**Bridge now:** [https://app.graphlinq.io/app/bridge](https://app.graphlinq.io/app/bridge)

**$GLQ Staking Migrated & Live On GraphLinq Chain!**

The GLQ token is now live on the GraphLinq Chain, enabling users to earn rewards in real time by staking GLQ. The platform offers tier advantages, and the higher the rank, the higher the annual percentage yields (APY) earned. However, withdrawing GLQ from the staking contract will result in a permanent loss of tier advantages, and users will be relegated to the lowest tier, T3. To regain rank, the user will have to stake with a new wallet.

**Graphlinq Chain Integration Live on Chainlist**

GraphLinq Chain is now officially listed on Chainlist, a comprehensive list of EVM networks that helps users connect their wallets and Web3 middleware providers to the appropriate Chain ID and Network ID. Being listed on Chainlist makes GraphLinq Chain more accessible to users who wish to connect to the network. The platform provides a guide through the process of adding GraphLinq Chain to your Metamask wallet via Chainlist.

**Build on GraphLinq Chain Without Coding Using ThirdWeb:**

Deploying smart contracts on GraphLinq Chain has never been easier, thanks to ThirdWeb. By simplifying the deployment process, developers can focus on building their dApps and creating innovative solutions for the blockchain space.

* Deploy Smart Contracts Without Coding

* Build Dapps on GraphLinq Chain

* Deploy Smart Contracts Easily and Cost Efficiently

**GraphLinq integration with OpenAI API into its IDE:**

This includes the integration of OpenAI API. Developers can create intelligent bots that can perform various tasks, such as generating personalized messages, answering complex questions, and analyzing data, among others.

**Launch of Graphlinq Assistant:**

Graphlinq has introduced its very own Al assistant bot that is powered by OpenAI models and GraphLing Engine/IDE & Speech-To-Text. You can now try it out at [http://ai.graphlinq.io](http://ai.graphlinq.io/)

**Added 300+ Logical Blocks:**

With over 300+ logical blocks now available on the GraphLinq IDE, creating even more complex no-code automation has become possible. Try it out now at [https://ide.graphlinq.io](https://ide.graphlinq.io/)

**AI/ML Logical Blocks Added on IDE:**

2 new logical blocks on GraphLinq IDE in Machine Learning: Spam Detection & Sentiment Analysis. Stay tuned for more information about Machine Learning logical blocks on our IDE.

**11 Nodes Running on Graphlinq Chain:**

Graphlinq’s network now has 11 nodes running on Graphlinq Chain, providing improved security, reliability, and a more decentralized network. To get started with running a node, check out [https://docs.graphlinq.io/run-a-node/installation](https://docs.graphlinq.io/run-a-node/installation)

**Partnership with CheckDot Protocol:**

Graphlinq has partnered with CheckDot Protocol, a solutions provider, to explore the possibilities of AI in the insurance sector. Together, they aim to develop new solutions by creating AI models for insurance that can be used for training and validating insurance claims.
