# GraphLinq IDE v1.3.2 Updates (Kucoin, Avascan, Snowtrace, etc.)

![][image_ref_MSo2VGtLS01ra2lJc3ZEQzg5SVdzZUJ3LnBuZw==]

Following last month’s [announcement](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/graphlinq-announces-partnership-with-avalanche-for-integration-on-their-nocode) of our [partnership](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2022-03-04/graphlinq-announces-partnership-with-avalanche-for-integration-on-their-nocode-ecosystem) with Avalanche, we are excited to release another update to the [GraphLinq IDE](https://ide.graphlinq.io/) platform. This latest update strengthens our integration with the KuCoin trading exchange. These additional eight KuCoin blocks, plus the blocks added for the Avalanche partnership, means that the GraphLinq IDE has over 275 blocks available for no-code development.

With the addition of these eight new KuCoin blocks, users can now create graphs that can perform the following functions:

* Place a limit buy order

* Place a limit sell order

* Execute a market buy order

* Execute a market sell order

* Get the trade status of an open order

* Cancel an order that hasn’t been executed

* Get full details of an order

* Get the best ask, best ask quantity, best bid, best bid quantity, last trade price, and last trade quantity

Eight New KuCoin Blocks

With these new blocks, a graph can now fully trigger and manage any trading scenario on the KuCoin exchange. Using the over 250 blocks already available on the GraphLinq IDE, we can envision many graphs that could trigger these blocks based on any condition you want to create. KuCoin is also home to one of the exchanges that support the GLQ token, offering both USDT and BTC trading pairs.

# Avalanche Blockchain

The GraphLinq partnership with Avalanche not only added access to the Avalanche blockchain, but also included blocks for [AvaScan](https://avascan.info/) and [SnowTrace](https://snowtrace.io/). These blocks included:

* Avalanche Connector Node

* Get Block Parameters

* Get Transaction Parameters

* Event On Avalanche Block

* Event On Avalanche Transaction

# SnowTrace

* SnowTrace Connector Node

* Get Balance of a Contract

* Get Token Supply

* Get Total AVAX on the C-Chain

* Get AVAX balance of a wallet address

# AvaScan

* Get Total Supply

* Get Global Statistics

* Get Staking Statistics

* Get Burned Fees Statistics

We look forward to improving our integrations with Avalanche, KuCoin, and all the partners of GraphLinq. If you create a graph using these new blocks or any of the blocks available on our IDE, don’t forget that it can be added to the [GraphLinq Marketplace](https://marketplace.graphlinq.io/)!
