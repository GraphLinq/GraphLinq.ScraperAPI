# GraphLinq Bridge Goes Live: Move Your GLQ from Ethereum Network to GraphLinq Chain

![][image_ref_MCpEbW5YaXBmVmtuSE9FcTFC]

We are excited to announce that the GraphLinq Bridge is finally live and ready to use! Now, you can move your GLQ from the Ethereum network to the GraphLinq Chain and vice versa, quickly & easily.

To bridge your GLQ, head over to the GraphLinq App on the Ethereum Mainnet once the bridge is live. Follow these simple steps:

1. Connect to GraphLinq App on Ethereum Mainnet

1. Make sure you are on the Bridge page or go to the Bridge page

1. Click on “Bridge in my GLQ”

4. Enter the amount of GLQ you would like to move to GraphLinq Chain

5. Click on “Deposit GLQ from ETH Network”

6. Confirm the transaction on your wallet extension to execute the transaction and wait for the confirmation

7. After the transaction is successfully confirmed, switch your wallet to the GraphLinq Chain’s network. If you don’t have GraphLinq Chain on your MetaMask, here is how [you can add it simply](https://docs.graphlinq.io/graphlinq-chain/networks/graphlinq-chain-mainnet/wallet/add-graphlinq-chain-to-metamask)

8. Click “Claim GLQ from GraphLinq Network” and confirm the transaction on your wallet extension. If you had the same address on the Ethereum chain, you’ve been airdropped enough Gas fees in GLQ to be able to claim your bridged GLQ on the new network.

In the future you’ll be able to bridge other tokens on the Graphlinq mainnet

Note: GLQ Holder Addresses from Ethereum Network have been airdropped [$GLQ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GLQ&src=cashtag_click) on the GraphLinq Chain for minimum gas for seamlessly bridging GLQ to the mainnet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nKrUPITqU5ttymCkw2IRjpqr_YYbbbFPahNNjcPS6SI/edit?usp=sharing…](https://t.co/gvpbTWrhha)

With the GraphLinq Bridge, you can quickly move your GLQ from Ethereum network to the GraphLinq Chain, allowing you to take advantage of the faster transactions, lower fees, and other benefits of the GraphLinq Chain.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q. Do I have to bridge compulsorily to the GraphLinq Mainnet?**

A. No, you can keep your GLQ on the Ethereum or Polygon chain, it's up to you. However, GraphLinq chain has higher staking rewards for GLQ, incentivization for running graphs and many more exciting use cases to be developed on the mainnet!

**Q. How can I bridge my GLQ from Polygon network to GraphLinq Chain?**

A. Use Polygon’s official bridge to convert your GLQ into Ethereum chain first and then use the above-mentioned steps to easily bridge to the GraphLinq Chain.

**Q**: **I have my GLQ staked on GraphLinq App. Is there any action required from my end?**

A: The staking on the Graphlinq App will be auto-migrated to GraphLinq Chain mainnet once staking on the new chain is live. If you have GLQ staked on the app, simply switch the network and you will find a “Claim” button on our network where you will be able to claim your staked GLQ on the new chain + 10% bonus airdrop of the amount of your GLQ staked, for being an integral part of the project. However, you will need to re-stake your GLQ on the new chain and you’ll also enjoy a higher APY of up to 35%. A more detailed article for staking will be posted next.

**Q:** **What are the benefits of moving GLQ to GraphLinq Chain?**

A: Moving GLQ to the GraphLinq Chain can provide several benefits, including Staking Rewards and more. We will offer higher APY to incentivize users to come to the Mainnet. GraphLinq Mainnet will also provide users with incentives by running a graphlinq engine locally.

**Q:** **Can I continue to keep erc20 version of GLQ?**

A: Yes, you can continue to hold the ERC-20 version of GLQ if you choose to do so. However, you won’t be able to take advantage of the features and benefits of the GraphLinq Chain if you continue to hold the ERC-20 version. If you want to use the GraphLinq Chain and its features, you will need to bridge your ERC-20 GLQ for the native GLQ on the GraphLinq Chain.

We hope you find the GraphLinq Bridge helpful, and we look forward to seeing more and more users bridging their GLQ to the GraphLinq Chain. If you have any questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to ask. Happy bridging!
