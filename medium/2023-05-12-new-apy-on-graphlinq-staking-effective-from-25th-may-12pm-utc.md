# New APY On GraphLinq Staking Effective from 25th May, 12PM UTC

![][image_ref_MSpJUDg0dWt4VC0xOFhxQy13cVFXeWZnLnBuZw==]

As [announced](https://graphlinq.medium.com/glq-staking-migrated-live-on-graphlinq-chain-70a8156d0875) earlier, the higher APY was introductory to celebrate our mainnet launch with our community. To ensure the long-term stability and sustainability of our ecosystem, effective on 25th May 12PM UTC, the APY on staking will be reduced as follows:

**Tier 1**: 17.5%

**Tier 2**: 7.5%

**Tier 3:** 4.5%

Please refer to this [article](https://graphlinq.medium.com/glq-staking-migrated-live-on-graphlinq-chain-70a8156d0875) to know how the tier mechanism works on GLQ Staking.

Also, **please make sure to claim your rewards regularly** ***before the update as the unclaimed rewards would also get reduced as per the new tiers***. With our staking mechanism generating real-time yield and gas fees so low on GLQChain, you can’t afford to miss out.

Thank you for your continued support as we work together to build a stronger and more resilient GraphLinq Chain. We’ll soon announce other ways to contribute to the network and run GraphLinq Engine to earn GLQ rewards. If you want to run a node on GLQChain, [check out our documentation](https://docs.graphlinq.io/run-a-node/installation) for the same. Stay tuned for more updates on our progress!
