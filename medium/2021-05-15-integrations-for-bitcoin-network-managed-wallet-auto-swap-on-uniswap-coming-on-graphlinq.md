# Integration For Bitcoin Network & Managed Wallet — Auto-Swap on Uniswap Coming On GraphLinq! + IDE & Analytics Updates

![][image_ref_MSpDUUU2NHQtaE9DbUlBSUtaWEZLY25BLnBuZw==]

It has almost been 2 months since we’ve been on this journey. We’ve come a long way in regards to our development progress. We already have over 200+ logical blocks on our [no-code drag & drop IDE for blockchain applications](http://ide.graphlinq.io), an [easier no-code interface for newcomers](http://app.graphlinq.io) and over 20 pre-made templates to choose from!

Before talking about the new and upcoming integrations on GraphLinq, let’s take a look at what’s new on our [IDE](http://ide.graphlinq.io) & [Analytics](http://analytics.graphlinq.io):

# **IDE v1.1.0**

* Project management system: You can now have multiple graph project in the IDE

* New [LiveCoinWatch](https://www.livecoinwatch.com/?utm_source=graphlinq-partner&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=new-integration) block, you will be able to fetch coin data from there (Volume, ATH, Rate, Supply …)

* Add a new API block, you are now able to create a complete API from the IDE, you can fetch POST data, add a cache system, etc.

* UX improvements

* Add more special action on blocks to help you to configure them more easily

# **GraphLinq Analytics v0.2.0 Updates:**

We just gave a new fresh look to the Analytics interface at: [analytics.graphlinq.io](https://analytics.graphlinq.io/):

**GraphLinq Analytics v0.2.0**

**New Features Added:**

Ability to sort live trade data columns by clicking the header

-> Filter live trade data by:

* Price using a slider

* Dropdown selector for buy/sell side

* Base or quote pair quantity using a slider

-> Search Maker column data

-> View transaction hash on Etherscan

-> Hide any trade column in settings

-> Trade data is now paginated:

* Browse to the next, previous, first, or last page

* Jump directly to any page

* Change how many trades show per page

-> Buy / Sell Pressure Gauge

-> New Unicrypt Charts

-> Unicrypt live trade data with full features

-> New trades flash as they appear

**Updates:**

* Full Unicrypt market data

* Better layout for smaller screens

* Refactored code for faster page response times and overall performance

* Minor bug fixes

And much more!

We are still working on gathering chain information to add more visibility for us and our partners and chain data, more updates will come soon on the [Unicrypt page here](https://analytics.graphlinq.io/analytics/unicrypt).

# **Creation of Managed Wallet On The GraphLinq Engine & Blockchain Transaction Broadcast:**

You can now create a managed Ethereum wallet which will be safely-stored and hashed in our database, to broadcast transaction for any of the blocks that is going to be available soon for chain execution.

The Auto-swap integration is only one of the potential options to come, you will have the possibility to issue your own ERC-20 token or Swap a token on Uniswap, or create an NFT, only with few blocks.

We will write a more complete review on this feature on how to, create your managed wallet in more detail and use it to broadcast your chains transactions.

# **Bitcoin Network Integration:**

We integrated the Bitcoin Network on the Engine! You can now create connectors for Bitcoin and follow transactions, blocks and events triggered on-chain to make specific analysis, the current integration support Bitcoin standard Base58 addresses type.

Here is a list of templates that you can use on the Engine (Over the IDE by the link below or directly on the app selecting from the template list and customizing it through the interface at [app.graphlinq.io](https://app.graphlinq.io)):

* [Receiving Transactions Infos (webhook) for a specific Wallet](https://ide.graphlinq.io/?loadGraph=22)

* [Sending a Discord Message on new transactions for a Wallet](https://ide.graphlinq.io/?loadGraph=23)

* [Gather last blocks Infos: tx hashes, estimated bitcoins values.. and report to Telegram](https://ide.graphlinq.io/?loadGraph=24)

* [Send a report of the bitcoin chain each X seconds on a Discord channel](https://ide.graphlinq.io/?loadGraph=25)

* [Add a command to a discord bot, fetch information about a wallet by typing “!wallet” + “hash” to fetch the number of txs, how much received, or spent.](https://ide.graphlinq.io/?loadGraph=26)

# **Upcoming Auto-Swap Integration On GraphLinq’s IDE, App & Engine**:

![Auto-Swap For Uniswap On GraphLinq IDE][image_ref_MSpBVTQtal9XTTBHSWh4Z05xQ19CSXNnLmpwZWc=]

The Uniswap protocol empowers developers, liquidity providers, and traders to participate in a decentralized financial marketplace that is open and accessible to all. After this powerful integration, users on GraphLinq will be able to automate swaps/trades on Uniswap based on events triggered off-chain or on-chain.

**Example 1**: Link Uniswap’s Auto-Swap connector with an off-chain block (like Coingecko or LiveCoinWatch) to make a trade on Uniswap when a certain price of your preferrable asset is met. The only thing you need to make sure of is that you have enough ETH on Uniswap for paying gas fees.

**Example 2:** Link Uniswap’s Auto-Swap connector with on-chain blocks (like Ethereum & BSC). You can set an auto-swap for functions like, if ETH fees drop by x% in ’n’ time, place a buy order on ETH/or any other ERC20 token on Uniswap. We believe this example has a huge potential in opening up the endless possibilities with no-code automation on Ethereum’s Blockchain.

The initial Uniswap integration is the first stepping stone for Graphlinq on the path of providing a seamless DeFi provisioning scheme for enterprise developers, traders, defi enthusiasts, system integrators, etc.

Our staking program is currently in progress and we will update about it soon, stay tuned!
