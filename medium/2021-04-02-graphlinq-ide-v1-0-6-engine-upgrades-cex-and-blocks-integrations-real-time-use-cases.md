# GraphLinq IDE v1.0.6 — Engine Upgrades, CEX and Blocks Integrations + Real-Time Use-Cases

![][image_ref_MSp3QkJxLVpJRUZROUIzZ01rRmEycmpRLnBuZw==]

We are glad to announce that we just pushed our release **v1.0.6** for the Protocol, and we have over 143 blocks available now on our IDE!

Today, we deployed a set of new blocks for making on-chain data more accessible and embracing CEX integrations and connections.

In this update, we’ve integrated new blocks to fetch data prices from Liquidity Provider tokens, and we will soon integrate more for lending / APY information over the different available protocols (such as [Compound](https://compound.finance/), [Aave](https://aave.com/), etc.)

Also, we’ve added connectors and blocks to check pairs and live events from certain exchanges which enables you to creating graphs for fetching, monitoring, analysing & storing data from these exchanges available on Graphlinq IDE.

Our goal is to have the entire Crypto/DeFi ecosystem directly available on Graphlinq Protocol, so you can create your graph and customize it.

> CEX added in this release:
 **- [*Bittrex*](https://global.bittrex.com/)
 - [*Kraken*](https://www.kraken.com/)
 - [*Bitfinex*](https://www.bitfinex.com/)
 - [*Huobi*](https://www.huobi.com/en-us/)
 - [*Coinex](https://www.coinex.com/)
(***[https://github.com/GraphLinq/GraphLinq.Exchange/commits/master](https://github.com/GraphLinq/GraphLinq.Exchange/commits/master))

> CEX already available:

> **- [*Binance*](http://binance.com)
- [*Kucoin*](http://kucoin.com)**

You can now use a type of block to save multiples set of data in one set, it’s called an Array object block:

An array is used to store a collection of data that can store a fixed-size collection of elements over a single variable, you can create a loop over your array to execute specific tasks.

As for the real-time Use-Case, our team made a graph template from Uniswap data to create a Telegram bot giving real-time prices of GLQ and details over our Group: [t.me/graphlinq](https://t.me/graphlinq)

This is directly broadcasted from the graph we created and deployed through the Engine on [app.graphlinq.io](https://app.graphlinq.io).

We will publish step-by-step youtube videos next week to help you teach create a similar bot from scratch from our IDE at [ide.graphlinq.io](https://ide.graphlinq.io) without any line of code.

Also, you can create your own price bot for your preferred digital assets, in 5 minutes, using a pre-made graph template. The template of this bot can be fetched from the list of templates available on the app interface.

Just click over the “**Make a Graph**” button on the app and choose this template.
Or you can directly check out the graph template by using this loader link:
