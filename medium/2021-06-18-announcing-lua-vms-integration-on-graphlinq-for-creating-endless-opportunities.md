# Announcing Lua VM’s Integration On GraphLinq For Creating Endless Opportunities

![][image_ref_MSotUHJmR09mOXpOUGxab2xoZFdBdmdBLmpwZWc=]

Today, we are announcing the release of Lua virtual machine on the GraphLinq network for scripting, offering even more freedom & flexibility while creating graphs. Not sure how to create graphs? [Learn how to create your first graph today on GraphLinq](https://graphlinq.medium.com/how-to-create-your-first-graph-on-graphlinq-protocol-63eaafda016)

### What is Lua, and what I can do with it on GraphLinq?

> Lua is a powerful and fast programming language that is easy to learn and use. Lua is designed to be a lightweight embeddable scripting language. It is used for all sorts of applications, from games to web applications and image processing.

Any developer can now create scripts in their personal graph to basically make any needed Arithmetic without having to need or ask for specific new blocks to the team, you can even call direct contract from-chain in your Lua script without having to make a connector: **The Lua VM is connected on-chain and ready to make requests to receive blockchain data such as an Ethereum specific contract**.

If you have been following GraphLinq you know that later this year we’ll be releasing a marketplace, where developers will be able to publish their own graph for a sale or propose their freelance service for a specific task to the community; Same as for any user: if you need something really specific to be developed to fetch on-chain data, or make a bot; anything related to what you can do with our [IDE](https://ide.graphlinq.io).

![Here is a sneak-peak of the marketplace currently being developed by our team.][image_ref_MSp1SUJNNDNvRVFTdTJENDM5U29UcHRnLnBuZw==]

With the current release, you can do read-only actions from Ethereum contracts within the Lua VM on your graph. In our next update, we will add the compatibility to execute transactions, which means that you will be able to call function contract and broadcast transaction execution to the Ethereum Chain *with your own Managed Wallet.*

![Here is a sample graph with Lua scripting to fetch data from the Glq Staking Contract. Few lines of code are enough to read from the chain contract and receive it in your own graph.][image_ref_MCprRFd4eEJKWjRmcjVXNVJXLnBuZw==]

### IDE Change Log # 1.3.0:

> - Introducing the GraphLinq Lua Scripting Engine, allowing you to read any smart contract data from the Ethereum blockchain (EVM compatible chains in a future update)
- New blocks for the Lua scripting is available on the IDE (Lua Block, JSON ABI Block, Smart Contract Reader Block)
- GraphLinq Lua Scripting documentation: [*docs-lua.graphlinq.io*](https://docs-lua.graphlinq.io/#/)
- Minimap on the IDE that helps you organize your graph more easily
- Engine optimization

### What is a Managed Wallet, and how to use it with Lua VM?

To execute transactions, for example, an auto swap on Uniswap (but basically, you can do any type of call you want on any contract with the Lua scripting), you’ll need an Ethereum wallet and ETH deposited to pay executions fees.

To make that happen, we created a managed wallet system that you can see in “[My Wallets](https://app.graphlinq.io/app/wallets)” on your [app’s dashboard](https://app.graphlinq.io/).

![By checking the “My Wallets” page on the app, you can create a new managed wallet and give it a specific name, the private key will be given to you at creation so that you can manage it wherever you need it.][image_ref_MSotYldXZEl1YzNLWVVjTldLQWtFM0JBLnBuZw==]

**You just need to send some ETH to your new address for the Gas fees of your transactions!** Then to use it for transaction broadcast, you will need to use it in your graph or your Lua script with the same wallet name to pay the fees and execute your transaction directly on the Ethereum chain.
