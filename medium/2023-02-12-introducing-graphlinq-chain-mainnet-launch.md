# Introducing GraphLinq Chain Mainnet Launch

![][image_ref_MSp3YXJ1QlRobUZ3bF9fWGllMFJvSHh3LmpwZWc=]

The wait is finally over! We are thrilled to announce the official launch of the GraphLinq Chain mainnet, an EVM-compatible PoA blockchain. This is a groundbreaking moment for the decentralized automation community. The Mainnet launch marks a significant milestone in the evolution of GraphLinq, as it brings us closer to realizing our vision of a more decentralized and automated future.

**GraphLinq Chain is here!**

Experience the power of decentralization and automation with GraphLinq Chain, a fast, secure, and scalable Proof-of-Authority, EVM compatible blockchain built to support the GraphLinq Protocol & more dApps.

GLQ is the native cryptocurrency on the GraphLinq Chain mainnet used to pay as gas for transactions on-chain as well as on GraphLinq IDE & Marketplace.

Network Specifications

The GraphLinq Chain has implemented a regional distribution of RPC nodes, providing optimized access for users in different geographic regions. By having multiple RPC nodes for different regions, the GraphLinq Chain aims to provide a faster and more reliable user experience for its community. Users are automatically connected to a node which is specifically optimized for their location, to interact with the GraphLinq Chain.

By providing optimized access for users in different regions, the GraphLinq Chain is working to ensure a fast and reliable experience for its community.

**About GraphLinq**

At the core of our mainnet is the GraphLinq Protocol, which consists of the GraphLinq IDE, Instant Wizard App, Engine, and Marketplace. The GraphLinq IDE is a drag-and-drop, no-code platform that allows users to easily create and deploy automation. The Instant Wizard App is an even more accessible solution for users with basic or no technical knowledge, as it offers pre-made templates that can be easily customized and deployed with a few clicks. The Engine is where the magic happens, executing automation on the GraphLinq Chain, while the Marketplace is a platform for buying, selling, and discovering .GLQ templates created by others.

**What sets the GraphLinq Chain apart from other blockchains**

GraphLinq Chain’s focus on decentralized automation leverages the trust and security of the blockchain to create a world where complex automation can be executed in a decentralized manner, without the need for intermediaries. This opens up new possibilities for automation and decentralization.

**Building on top of GraphLinq Chain**

Since our network is evm-compatible, you can get started with your existing or new ethereum based smart contracts & dApps easily on GraphLinq Chain. In the foreseeable future, we will have more dApps from the community running on our mainnet.

**Bridging GLQ**

With the Mainnet launch, 500 Million GLQ tokens will be swappable from the Ethereum chain to the GraphLinq Chain. 150 Million GLQ has been introduced to support ecosystem growth, incentives for stakers, engine runners on the Mainnet, and development needs. If you have GLQ on a CEX, wait for them to support the migration. We’re already in touch with top GLQ-listed CEXs to auto-migrate GLQ from ethereum to the new mainnet and we will soon share an update on that! If however, you’re holding GLQ out of CEXs in a self-custodial wallet, you can [bridge your GLQ by following these simple steps](https://docs.graphlinq.io/graphlinq-chain/glq/bridge) once the [bridge](https://app.graphlinq.io/bridge) is live.

**Validators**

GraphLinq Chain is a Proof of Authority (PoA) blockchain, where a select group of validators is responsible for validating transactions and maintaining the integrity of the network. In the near future, we plan to open up the network to more validators. This will provide a more decentralized and secure network, while also allowing more validators to contribute to the growth of the ecosystem. To further promote transparency and accountability, we will also release an app that will showcase the amount of GLQ staked by each validator. This will give the community a clear view of who the validators are and how much they are contributing to the network, helping to ensure that the network remains secure and stable for all users.

**Staking**

For the next few months, we will offer higher APY to incentivize users to come to the Mainnet. The [staking on our app](https://app.graphlinq.io/staking/) will be auto-migrated to GraphLinq Chain mainnet once staking on the new chain is live. If you have GLQ staked on the app, simply switch the network and you will find a “Claim” button on our network where you will be able to claim your staked GLQ on the new chain.

**Engine Rewards**

Soon the GraphLinq Mainnet will also provide users with incentives by [running a graphlinq engine](https://docs.graphlinq.io/dev-tooling/engine/running-an-engine-locally) locally, as users are executing graphs on-chain which will trigger and notify nodes about their active contribution to the network, which in turn will reward them with GLQ.

**Conclusion**

We believe the GraphLinq Chain launch is just the beginning of a new and exciting chapter for GraphLinq. With the introduction of the Mainnet, we are laying the foundation for a more decentralized, efficient, and automated future. In the course of the next few days/weeks, we will work with CoinMarketCap, Coingecko, LiveCoinWatch, etc. for reflecting correct and up-to-date information. We’re also going to launch the bridge, staking soon, and work with GLQ-listed CEXs to support the migration and our new chain with exciting campaigns! Stay tuned.
